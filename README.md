A dashboard which displays info of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) using Covalent API. Supports multiple chains.

API Used: api.covalenthq.com/v1/:chainId/xy=k/:dexname/ecosystem/

Currently, the Covalent API needs a little improvement and does not fetch precise data for every chain and dex combination, but at least one dex is fetched for most of the included chains.
